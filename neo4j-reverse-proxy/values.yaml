  # Name of the kubernetes service created using neo4j helm chart. This service should have the ports 7474 and 7687 open
  # This could be the admin service ex: "standalone-admin" or the loadbalancer service ex: "standalone"
  # serviceName , namespace , domain together combined will form the complete k8s service url. Ex: standalone-admin.default.svc.cluster.local
  serviceName: "standalone-admin"
  # The namespace should be same as that of the running Neo4j standalone or cluster
  # Default value is "default"
  namespace: ""
  # default is set to cluster.local
  domain: "cluster.local"
  # This port needs to be same as that of ingress port (80 or 443)
  # This is the port on which the http server will be listening on and the kubernetes service will be using the same port as well to keep things simple
  port: "80"
  # This is optional and will create a default ingress-nginx configuration running on the port defined in reverseProxy.port
  # This assumes ingress-nginx controller is already installed in your kubernetes cluster.
